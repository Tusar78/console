# Run JavaScript in the Console.
- Rather than typing `document.querySelector()` to select an element, you can type `$()`.This syntax is inspired by jQuery, but it's not actually jQuery. It's just an alias for `document.querySelector()`.

# Watch JavaScript values in real-time with Live Expressions.
> If you find yourself typing the same JavaScript expression in the Console repeatedly, you might find it easier to create a Live Expression. With Live Expressions, you type an expression once and then pin it to the top of your Console. The value of the expression updates in near real-time.
